### Uncertainty Propogation
UncertaintyPropogation.m contains initialization of nominal values and their uncertainties, using the class defined at UData/UObj.m

Results are viewed using three methods: direct calculation via error propogation rules, symbolic substitution after partially deriving all components, and Monte Carlo.

## Archived Scripts
Initial monte carlo simulations, sensitivities, mass and volume approach comparisons, and total uncertainty substitution calculation.
